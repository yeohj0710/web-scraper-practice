# Web Scraper Practice

This project is created for practicing web scraping using Python.

It focuses on two main aspects:

1. `static-scraper.py`: Scraping static websites without any interaction.
2. `dynamic-scraper.py`: Scraping data from dynamic web pages, which require loading content based on user interaction.
